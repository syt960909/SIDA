The data used in the code can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vxet6GnzgonI0g7CxlrAAYdHzSNq-G8b).

The code is implemented based on tensorflow==2.4.0.

train.py can be directly run to train a model, and the trained model will be saved under the project folder.

Pancreas_5dataset_all_cls.ipynb is a full instruction notebook, with training, visualization of embedding space and the leave-one-out cell type mapping experiments.
